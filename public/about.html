                Hello World! I'm a junior at Northwestern University pursuing a double major in
                mathematics and computer science, a minor in chemistry, and an M.S. in computer
                science. I'm an undergraduate mathematics researcher looking into discrete geometry
                and a graduate computer science researcher exploring the use of AI in narrative
                based games. I love developing games and am currently a software engineer at
                <a href="https://www.overture.games/" class="inline-link" target="_blank">Overture Games</a>, a
                startup founded at <a href="https://thegarage.northwestern.edu/" class="inline-link" target="_blank">The
                    Garage</a> at Northwestern making games to help make practice more fun for musicians.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've worked on a handful of projects, many of which are works in progress. My
                projects are a mix of experimenting with tutorials, creating games for class,
                and developing games and software for Overture. At Overture, I'm working on a
                game called <a href="./projects/intervallic.html" class="inline-link">Intervallic</a>,
                which currently allows players to control an adorable robot-alien-space cat with input
                from a midi instrument. By the end of each level, the player will have played through
                an entire song! I have been playing piano for over 13 years now, and I can definitely
                say that working on this project has helped me practice more!
            </p>
            <p>
                I love working with Unity and programming in C#, but I also have some experience
                with Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and many more. I am also familiar with many
                languages and programs used for math, such as LaTeX, Mathematica, and MatLab.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm proud to say that I've been doing research since my first year at Northwestern.
                I've worked with professors in the mathematics and computer science departments,
                namely <a href="https://sites.math.northwestern.edu/~sweng/" class="inline-link" target="_blank">Dr.
                    Shuyi Weng</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~ian/" class="inline-link"
                    target="_blank">Dr. Ian Horswill</a>, respectively. My <a href="./projects/polygonalfolding.html"
                    class="inline-link">math research</a>
                explores the construction of three-dimensional shapes from two-dimensional polygons, which has been
                presented in both oral presentation and paper formats. My <a href="./projects/imaginarium.html"
                    class="inline-link">computer science research</a> is being done in tandem with my Master's degree,
                and I am currently working on expanding Ian's experimental language, <a
                    href="https://github.com/ianhorswill/Imaginarium" class="inline-link"
                    target="_blank">Imaginarium</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that you've heard plenty about the work that I do, I'm sure you'd be surprised to hear
                that I have plenty of free time! In this free time, I love to play video games (NieR: Automata,
                Persona 5 Royal, and Cooking Simulator VR are some of my current favorites), shop, play piano,
                <a href="https://musescore.com/user/917141/sheetmusic" class="inline-link" target="_blank">arrange music
                    for piano</a>, create art, and read.
            </p>
            <p>
