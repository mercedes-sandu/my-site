                    Riverswood Manor is a 3D game I made in two weeks for my final project in COMP_SCI 376. You play as a butler in a manor 
                    where the Countess has been murdered by the Count. You start in your room, hearing a scream and seeing a note being 
                    slipped under your door from the Countess. From there, you must figure out how to escape the manor. After escaping 
                    the room through the painting in the wall, you enter the Count's office, where you must solve a puzzle to unlock the 
                    hidden door in the bookcase. The game ends when you escape.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are multiple systems in play with this game, including cued game events, an interaction system to pick up and touch 
                    various objects, and a UI inventory system to store and view clues. The office scene requires the player to listen to audio 
                    cues played from a music box and find corresponding items in the room that make the same sounds. These objects are distinctly 
                    colored red, yellow, and green, matching the buttons on the wall by the fireplace to make a code. If the right code is 
                    entered, the player successfully escapes the manor.

                    The game was made using Unity and C#.
