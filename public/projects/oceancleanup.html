                    Ocean Cleanup is a game my team made for the Progression Mechanics Game Jam hosted at Northwestern. You control a cute 
                    low-poly submarine that must explore the ocean and collect trash to clean it up. As you collect trash, you gain points 
                    which are expendable on ship upgrades. We had about eight weeks to complete this project. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On this project, I worked as both a 3D artist and a programmer. As an artist, I created all of the 3D models (aside from 
                    the terrain, which was created using a Unity package which procedurally generates low-poly terrain) and their respective 
                    materials using Blender. As shown in a screenshot below, I made
                    <ul>
                        <li>the submarine (the propellers rotate!)</li>
                        <li>the various plastics (bottles, cups, bowls, lids, balloons, and utensils), and</li>
                        <li>the aqutatic plants (corals, kelps, and mushrooms).</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a programmer, I was mainly responsible for coding the plastics, level manager, shop, and UI. This was my first experience 
                    with a game jam, so I underestimated how quickly time would fly (especially doing this during the school year). I would have 
                    loved to have a lot more mechanics and areas in the game, but I'm still proud of what we were able to accomplish in the time 
                    allotted. I'm looking forward to finishing the project some day!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game was made using Unity, C#, and Blender. 
                </p>
                <h4>Features:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Custom 3D models for the submarine (with moving components), plastics, and aquatic plants</li>
                    <li>Two levels and areas of exploration</li>
                    <li>A third-person controller that allows the player to control the direction and yaw/pitch/roll of the vessel</li>
                    <li>In-game UI overlay to see how many pieces of plastic and how much currency you've collected</li>
                    <li>A UI overlay shop to purchase ship upgrades (speed and collision radius) with in-game currency</li>
                    <li>A level control script that detects when the player has completed a level (collected all pieces of plastic), and 
                        advances the player to the next level</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Below are some screenshots of the game.
