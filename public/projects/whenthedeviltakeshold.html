                    When the Devil Takes Hold is a top-down puzzle and fighting game my team made in six weeks in COMP_SCI 377. You play 
                    as a girl who signed a pact with a demon to kill people for him in exchange for her life. If you do not do so fast 
                    enough, then the pact is being breached and you must fight for your life against the demon. Thus, the game is split 
                    into two core game loops: one where the player is solving puzzles to murder NPCs, and one where the player is fighting 
                    or trying to escape from the demon. You win the game by either completing all the puzzles or killing the demon, and you 
                    lose by dying to the demon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the start of every puzzle level, a timer is displayed at the top of the screen. You must complete the puzzle within 
                    this time, but killing an NPC grants you a bit of extra time. If the timer runs out, the player is teleported to the 
                    fight sequence. At this point, the player can either fight to the death or find objects to hide behind, making the demon 
                    somehow forget their existence, teleporting the player back to the last puzzle they failed to complete. But, be careful! 
                    Hiding penalizes the player by decreasing the time allowed to complete the puzzle they return to.

                    The game was made using Unity and C#.
