                    Papa's What-Is-Going-On-Eria is a game I made in a week for one of the freestyle projects in COMP_SCI 376. It is 
                    largely inspired by <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-papas-pizzeria" target="_blank">Papa's 
                    Pizzeria</a>. You control a character in a top-down 2D kitchen, receiving randomized orders for burgers and soda. You 
                    must go to each station in the kitchen to receive and then make the order. The basic game loop is as follows: (1) go to 
                    the order counter to receive the ticket with all the order details, (2) go to the stove to prepare the meat that goes on 
                    the burger, (3) go to the cutting board to assemble the burger with all of the proper addons and condiments, (4) go to the
                    soda machine to pour the correct soda into the cup, and (5) go to the lunch tray to serve the order. This process repeats 
                    over and over until your time runs out, so the goal is to complete as many orders as possible and thus maximize your score.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you complete orders, you may notice something slightly odd happening. It seems that every time you complete an order, 
                    one of the ingredients randomly gets corrupted and you can no longer use it! The corrupted ingredients may still pop up on 
                    the ticket, just try to carry on and ignore them. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game was made using Unity and C#. For more details and specific instructions/controls, please see the <a class="inline-link"
                    href="https://github.com/mercedes-sandu/Papas-What-Is-Going-On-Eria/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank">README file</a> for 
                    the game.
