p| Intervallic is Overture Games' first title. The game itself is a 2D runner that allows users to play their instrument to control an alien-robot-space cat and navigate through a level, dodging obstacles and collecting traces and samples. The notes that are played correspond to vertical movement of the cat. For example, playing up on a scale allows the cat to move vertically upward, and playing down on a scale moves the cat vertically downward. This way, by the end of the level, the user has played through an entire song. The game currently allows input from any Midi device as well as computer keyboard and mouse. We aim to implement touch screen input as well as generic audio input, so anyone with any instrument could play the game. You play as Starburst, a nerdy music-lover working to explore strange planets with her companion robot cat (who the player controls with their instrument). As you continue playing, you make new friends and play more fun songs.
