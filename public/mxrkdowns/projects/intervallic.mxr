p| //intervallic// is overture games' first title. the game itself is a 2d runner that allows users to play their instrument to control an alien-robot-space cat and navigate through a level, dodging obstacles and collecting traces and samples. the notes that are played correspond to vertical movement of the cat. for example, playing up on a scale allows the cat to move vertically upward, and playing down on a scale moves the cat vertically downward. this way, by the end of the level, the user has played through an entire song. the game currently allows input from any instrument, midi device, as well as computer keyboard and mouse. you play as starburst, a nerdy music-lover working to explore strange planets with her companion robot cat (who the player controls with their instrument). as you continue playing, you make new friends and play more fun songs.

p| at overture, i worked as a software developer and got promoted to lead frontend engineer. additionally, i learned extensively about the other aspects of game development, such as art, music, design, and marketing. as a software developer, i was primarily in charge of designing and implementing the main game mechanics and features as well as majority of the frontend aspects (ui/ux). in particular, i programmed things like player movement, main menu and pause menu, collectibles, obstacles, and in-game ui. as frontend lead, i was responsible for doing all ui/ux design and communicating regularly with the art team to get both game assets and ui assets designed, scoped, and completed on time according to sprints and deadlines. i spent a lot of time understanding the digital art process, how long it takes, and how to coordinate between the team's artists and designers.

p| working on //intervallic// was a great experience where i learned to work with a small team and undergo the fast-paced development process. i worked there my junior and senior years of university, leading up to the release of //intervallic// in early access on october 6th, 2023. you can access the steam page [[store.steampowered.com/app/2270460/Intervallic here]]!
