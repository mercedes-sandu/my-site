p| My first internship during Summer 2023 was at Abbott Laboratories, working in Downtown Chicago. I was brought on as an IT intern, working on my primary assignment, an E-commerce React webapp. On this project, I worked primarily on two teams as a frontend developer: pre-purchase and post-purchase. The pre-purchase team mainly focused on the product catalog and pre-screening surveys, while the post-purchase team focused on order histroy, tracking, and test results.
p| As a frontend developer, I primarily worked with designers, other engineers, and project managers to modify existing components and create new ones. A good majority of my work consisted of ADA audits, where I would modify components to make them more accessible through color uses, ARIA labels, focus states, and more. With every change that was made for accessibility, I had to run Lighthouse tests and document the passing results. I also worked on creating new components, such as skeleton loaders for cards, redesigned footers, and more.
p| The webapp was developed using React, Azure, and MUI. Majority of the languages used were TypeScript, CSS, and HTML.
p| Another part of my internship was a showcase project done with a team of other interns. We were assigned to work with a team in the Nutrition division of Abbott to improve UI/UX of their existing data analytics projects. We did a full visual and structural redesign of a PowerBI dashboard and a PowerApp, as well create templates for future dashboards and components they could use in Figma. We began the project by analyzing the current dashboard and app, noting what worked and what didn't work, and then creating a list of user stories. As lead designer, I then created a Figma mockup of the dashboard and app, and then my teammembers implemented the new designs in PowerBI and PowerApp, after iterating upon it with the Nutrition team. I was also responsible for documenting the changes we made with rationale in a PowerPoint for every page we changed. At the end of the internship period, we presented our project to the entire IT department as well as a panel of directors and leaders.
