p| SonglyBot is a small Discord API Python bot that I developed to help foster a community in the [[<https://discord.gg/8qn2m3uKan> Overture Games Discord server]]. I had a really fun time learning to use Python and Discord API to create this bot, as well as Amazon Web Services to host it 24/7.
p| I certainly plan on expanding the bot and adding more features as we release our first game and the community grows. If you have any ideas, I would love to discuss them!
