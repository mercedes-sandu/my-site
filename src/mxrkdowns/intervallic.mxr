p| //Intervallic// is Overture Games' first title. The game itself is a 2D runner that allows users to play their instrument to control an alien-robot-space cat and navigate through a level, dodging obstacles and collecting traces and samples. The notes that are played correspond to vertical movement of the cat. For example, playing up on a scale allows the cat to move vertically upward, and playing down on a scale moves the cat vertically downward. This way, by the end of the level, the user has played through an entire song. The game currently allows input from any Midi device as well as computer keyboard and mouse. We aim to implement touch screen input as well as generic audio input, so anyone with any instrument could play the game. You play as Starburst, a nerdy music-lover working to explore strange planets with her companion robot cat (who the player controls with their instrument). As you continue playing, you make new friends and play more fun songs.
p| At Overture, I have worked as a software developer and recently got promoted to lead frontend engineer. Despite this, I have learned so much about the other aspects of game development, such as art, music, design, and marketing. As a software developer, I have been primarily in charge of designing and implementing the main game mechanics and features as well as majority of the frontend aspects (UI/UX). In particular, I've programmed things like player movement, main menu and pause menu, collectibles, obstacles, and in game UI.
p| Through Overture and working on //Intervallic//, I have discovered how much I like startup environments and agile software development. It has been a great experience to work with a small team and undergo the fast-paced development process. I am continuing to work part-time during the academic year to fulfill whatever will be needed for our early release. //Intervallic// has been released in [[<https://store.steampowered.com/app/2270460/Intervallic/> early access on Steam]] on October 6th, 2023!
